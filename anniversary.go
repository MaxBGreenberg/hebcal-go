/**
 * Calculates yahrzeit.
 * `hyear` must be after original `gdate` of death.
 * Returns `undefined` when requested year preceeds or is same as original year.
 *
 * Hebcal uses the algorithm defined in "Calendrical Calculations"
 * by Edward M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz.
 *
 * The customary anniversary date of a death is more complicated and depends
 * also on the character of the year in which the first anniversary occurs.
 * There are several cases:
 *
 * * If the date of death is Marcheshvan 30, the anniversary in general depends
 *   on the first anniversary; if that first anniversary was not Marcheshvan 30,
 *   use the day before Kislev 1.
 * * If the date of death is Kislev 30, the anniversary in general again depends
 *   on the first anniversary â€” if that was not Kislev 30, use the day before
 *   Tevet 1.
 * * If the date of death is Adar II, the anniversary is the same day in the
 *   last month of the Hebrew year (Adar or Adar II).
 * * If the date of death is Adar I 30, the anniversary in a Hebrew year that
 *   is not a leap year (in which Adar only has 29 days) is the last day in
 *   Shevat.
 * * In all other cases, use the normal (that is, same month number) anniversary
 *   of the date of death. [Calendrical Calculations p. 113]
 * @example
 * import {HebrewCalendar} from '@hebcal/core';
 * const dt = new Date(2014, 2, 2); // '2014-03-02' == '30 Adar I 5774'
 * const hd = HebrewCalendar.getYahrzeit(5780, dt); // '30 Sh\'vat 5780'
 * console.log(hd.greg().toLocaleDateString('en-US')); // '2/25/2020'
 * @param {number} hyear Hebrew year
 * @param {Date|HDate} gdate Gregorian or Hebrew date of death
 * @return {HDate} anniversary occurring in hyear
