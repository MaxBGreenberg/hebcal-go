GetYahrzeit calculates yahrzeit.

Returns an error when requested year preceeds or is same as original year.

by Edward M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz.

The customary anniversary date of a death is more complicated and depends
also on the character of the year in which the first anniversary occurs.
There are several cases:
  - If the date of death is Marcheshvan 30, the anniversary in general depends
    on the first anniversary; if that first anniversary was not Marcheshvan 30,
    use the day before Kislev 1.
  - If the date of death is Kislev 30, the anniversary in general again depends
    on the first anniversary â€” if that was not Kislev 30, use the day before
    Tevet 1.
  - If the date of death is Adar II, the anniversary is the same day in the
    last month of the Hebrew year (Adar or Adar II).
  - If the date of death is Adar I 30, the anniversary in a Hebrew year that
    is not a leap year (in which Adar only has 29 days) is the last day in
    Shevat.
  - In all other cases, use the normal (that is, same month number) anniversary
    of the date of death. [Calendrical Calculations p. 113]

The birthday of someone born in Adar of an ordinary year or Adar II of
a leap year is also always in the last month of the year, be that Adar
or Adar II. The birthday in an ordinary year of someone born during the
first 29 days of Adar I in a leap year is on the corresponding day of Adar;
in a leap year, the birthday occurs in Adar I, as expected.

Someone born on the thirtieth day of Marcheshvan, Kislev, or Adar I
has his birthday postponed until the first of the following month in
years where that day does not occur. [Calendrical Calculations p. 111]
